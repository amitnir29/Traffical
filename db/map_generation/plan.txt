We want to generate a map.

First, a certain lane's data is represented using:
RoadLane:
    road_id: int
    lane_num: int

A map is represented using two lists:
1. RoadData:
    idnum: int
    coordinates: List[Tuple[Point, Point]]
    num_lanes: int
    max_speed: float
2. JunctionData:
    idnum: int
    coordinates: List[Point]
    goes_to: List[Tuple[RoadLane, RoadLane]]
    traffic_lights: List[List[RoadLane]]
    traffic_lights_coords: List[Point]
    num_traffic_lights: int
    * if the junction contains no traffic lights, then the last 3 fields are empty lists or zero

Our goal is to generate a map such that:
1. No roads cross each other
2. A junction is a connection between roads
3. For each road, the width matches number of lanes
4. No two roads or two junctions have the same idnum
5. In the goes_to of a junction, no road is both "From road" and "To road"
6. The length of the traffic_lights and traffic_lights_coords lists match the num_traffic_lights field of the junction
7. Road parts have a minimum length
8. Roads have a maximum total length
9. Roads have a minimum distance from each other, side-wise
10. Roads connect only through a junction
11. All RoadData have a valid road_id and a matching valid lane_num based on number of lanes in the road
12. Each junction connects at least 3 roads

The algortihm:
1. We start with a rectangle grid, each point represents a junction (which consists of 4 points - for each side).
2. Now, we will add all possible edges between the inside 4 points to their neighbors (represents road sections,
    we are not deciding on number of lanes, just creating the general shape of the map for now).
3. Now, we will remove edges until each of the inside points has at most one edge connectes.
    That means that the junction will have more than one connection but each side of it won't.
4. Each Junction that has 0/1 connections to it will be removed.
5. Each junction that has only 2 connections wiil be removed as well but the to road sections will be combined
    into one that goes through the part of the map where the junction used to be to avoid collisions in road sections.
6. Roads that are diagonal will be split into 2 parts in order to be ok, and we will need to make sure that
    they don't collide with other road sections.
7. todo Decide traffic direction in each road sections and put traffic lights.
